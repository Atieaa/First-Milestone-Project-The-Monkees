# First Milestone Project - The Monkees

This project is designed for the pupose of utilising what has been taught from the Code Institute. The main aim of the project is to build a static (front-end) website for a band known as the Monkees as requested by the client's represensitives within the briefing.

The Monkees started out within their acting career in 1965 with the intention of creating a TV show that would try and mimic the Beatles band yet fail at becoming as successful as them. Despite their inital purpose however, the Monkees had become one of the most iconic bands during the late 1960's among Queen and the Beatles!
 
## User Experience (UX)

The UX design process was intialised as a means for making sure that the project is to become as successful as possible for the key users/stakeholders involved. For this project in particular, the 5 planes of UX design; Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface were used to the best of my ability given the available information within the briefing as well as additional research. 

Please refer to the following links below in demonstrating the UX process (shown within the UX Design directory):

<b>Strategy:</b> Includes the goal and objectives of three different users involved as well as some research on competitors - <a href="UX-Design/Strategy-Plane.pdf">Click Here</a>

<b>Scope:</b> Includes the user stories and the generated functions/features (The functions/features will be mentioned in the next section below) - <a href="UX-Design/Scope-Plane.pdf">Click Here</a>  

<b>Structure:</b> The structure plane was taken into consideration during the wireframes process and so is shown within the skeleton plane.

<b>Skeleton:</b> This plane solely involves the use of wireframes with the addition of Information Architecture (IA) by placing the functions in certain parts of the website for a specified reason/importance. The wireframes used display both in desktop and in mobile version - <a href="UX-Design/Skeleton-Plane.pdf">Click Here</a>  

<b>Surface:</b> With a aid of research, the surface plane was dealt with as the coding for the project had started. 

## Functions/Features
 
### Existing Functions/Features
- Navigation - This includes the logo on every page, a different quote/slogan on every page for fans and potential fans to reminisce with, Title of the band and the links to navigate to the other pages with ease.
- Hamburger Navigation - Used for mobile display only. Only includes the title and the hamburger icon with a dropdown page list for the user.
- Footer - Social media links provided to allow users to explore more into the band. Trademark signature inserted for copyright purposes. A subscription button included for users to keep in touch with the band’s website.
- Home Page - Either a slideshow (carousel) of photos OR a background photo with big and clear headings to entice the audience. An all-time classic music video inserted. Instagram pictures of the band together.
- About Page - Includes main picture of the band members together with some generic background information on the Monkees and a separate space for each of the members with their relative pictures and personal background information.
- Album Page - Album pictures inserted as modal items; when clicked on, the song lists within that album are shown. clips of songs inserted to showcase their music and additional Youtube videos are inserted at the end.
- News Page - Any relevant information on the past/current/future activities associated with the Monkees. This will consist of short snippets of information followed by a floated picture and a link to the full information describing the event/news. Subscription Jumbotron should be implemented at this point to allow user to receive any updates via email. 
- Contact Page - A form that asks for the user’s full name, email address, an option to choose a performing event (examples are weddings or Christmas parties etc.) and a message box for any additional information the user wants to add.
- Scroll to top - This feature has been added to allow the users to automatically scroll back to the beginning of the page with ease.

### Functions/Features Left to Implement
- Live Concert Page - A potential to include any upcoming performance by the Monkees with their corrosponding dates and tickets purchase.
- Shop Page - As with the competitors, a shop page consisting of the Monkees most valuable merchandise could be included for sale in particular for loyal fans to buy from. Consequently, a payment transaction feature would be needed to carry out the shop page's objective.
- Banner - The banner could be included at the very most top of every page to indicate an important live update with the Monkees.
- News Page - A continous way to bring on the next current news on the Monkees would be ideal. 

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
