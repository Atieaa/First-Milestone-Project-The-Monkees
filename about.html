                    <p class="paragraph-font text-justify">Originally formed in 1965 in Los Angeles by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, the members consisted of 3 Americans and 1 English musical acting quartet who were specifically created for the television series called "The Monkees". As
                        described by Micky Dolenz (one of the members), The Monkees initial sole purpose was to create a "TV show that would try and mimic The Beatles band yet fail at becoming as successful as them". Despite what Dolenz thought the show
                        was about, ironically The Monkees became one of the most successful bands within the 1960's!</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-font text-justify">During the two years of their acting career for “The Monkees” TV series, the band were continually fighting for their right to be able to supervise all musical output under the band’s name. Thus, the television show was cancelled in
                        1968 but the band continued to pursue their musical career. The Monkees have sold more than 75 million records worldwide and there have been reports that The Monkees outsold the Beatles and Rolling Stones combined in 1967!</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-font text-justify">The group have been reuniting and touring during the past couple of decades due to a revival interest of the television show that came on in 1986. Unfortunately, Jones had passed away in February 2012 which had sparked the rest of
                        the members to reunite and continue the legacy of The Monkees. Dolenz and Tork are forming the core of the band with Nesmith occasionally joining in touring around the world from 2012 until now.</p>
